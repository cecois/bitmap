    <p>This is a map of every spatial reference from every <em>Comedy Bang! Bang!</em> episode ever recorded. You should consider it as a kind of pilot release of a larger project in which every individual trope and recurring bit ("Please call me Garry," "My Wife!" "Titular," etc. - see the BitTracker section, below) will be not only searchable but supercuttable and wikified. Yeah, so all Earwolf fans can help track the recurring CBB bits (or maybe there will be one each made for Spontaneanation, UtU2tM, Womp it Up, etc.). But that's taking longer than this already has and will require a much different web app to deliver. So while this thing technically does deliver every bit logged so far, its primary purpose is to render those with mappable locations. Such as:</p><p>
    <!-- And for real the reason to do it is that the universe of CBB's characters - when canon - is so rich and sprawling that I wanted it all in one place, where I could wade into it from multiple angles, aspects, and facets. e.g. I wanted be able to visualize...
    So for now it's just a map of places that comprise the world of the CBB canon (and perhaps its diaspora). -->

<div class="block"><h4>BitTracker?!</h4>


    <p>
So more about this bittracker: <strong>Yeah, it's a <em>BitTracker</em></strong>. A tracker of bits. How many times (and when) <em>My wife!</em>; how many times (and when) <em>Hee-hee. Shamone. Where's Lisa Marie? Dah! Where 'dem elephant bones? Where's Macaulay? Dah! Shamone. Hoo. Where my glove? Hoo.</em>; how many times (and when) a classic <em>Would You Rather</em> blunder? That sort of thing. But in a way that doesn't just list them out (or map them, when possible) and instead wraps some other methods of access -- a supercutter, perhaps (e.g. "click - supercut all the My Wife!s together" or "click - supercut all of Bob Ducca's lists together"). Or the original dream - something built on the SoundCloud copies of the episodes that lets everybody add/edit/annotate all this bullshit. So think something like the CBB wikia, but with a finer granularity and a more data-focused approach.</p></div>
<div class="block"><h4>A Note on Scope</h4>
<p>Included here are ~all locations that were <em>generated</em> during the show. Meaning only locations that were somehow parts of a bit or part of something intentionally funny <em>and</em> part of a contribution to the show are included. Meaning that if Todd Barry plugs his gig at the Chuckle Hut or we hear that Jimmy Pardo ran into Nick Kroll at a grilled cheese sandwich place irl, it doesn't need to be here. But <span class="loc-trigger" data-toggle="tooltip" data-string="point:46"><span class="loc-string">Huell Howser's birth bed</span><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-map-marker"></i></span>? Yes. And <span class="loc-trigger" data-toggle="tooltip" data-string="point:404"><span class="loc-string">that place that almost housed a Victor Diamond show</span><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-map-marker"></i></span>? Yes. And <span class="loc-trigger" data-toggle="tooltip" data-string="point:13"><span class="loc-string">The Grove</span><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-map-marker cbb-marker-inline"></i></span> and <span class="loc-trigger" data-toggle="tooltip" data-string="poly:1329867"><span class="loc-string">the ArcLight</span><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-map-marker"></i></span> (including <span class="loc-trigger" data-toggle="tooltip" data-string="line:31968"><span class="loc-string">Cactus Tony's bus route <em>to</em> it</span><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-map-marker"></i></span>) and <span class="loc-trigger" data-toggle="tooltip" data-string="point:96"><span class="loc-string">the Pantages</span><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-map-marker cbb-marker-inline"></i></span> and <span class="loc-trigger" data-toggle="tooltip" data-string="poly:789921"><span class="loc-string">Bob Ducca's beloved Castaic</span><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-map-marker cbb-marker-inline"></i></span> and <span class="loc-trigger" data-toggle="tooltip" data-string="point:7"><span class="loc-string">Six Flags Magic Mountain</span><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-map-marker cbb-marker-inline"></i></span> are all here.</p></div>
<!-- <div class="block"><h4>Is <em>Everything</em> Geocoded?</h4>
<p>But no, not everything is in here. Yet. Once I realized I wanted to do this, I started re-listening from episode 1, logging locations instead of bits (which I'll pick back up later). I'm only through #143, so there will be plenty more added here in due time. I <em>may</em> add the ability for users to submit/edit locations, but that requires the addition of a whole other layer of app logic. The crowd-sourcing model will better suit the BitTracker anyway.</p></div> -->


<div class="block"><h4>What's Next?</h4>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>As episodes are released, locations and bits will be added.</li>
            <li>As old episodes are revisited, missed locations and bits will be added.</li>
            <li>The web app might get an inline audio player (with or without annotation/edit capabilities).</li>
            <li>Some poor asshole needs to build the full BitTracker still (and fold this into it).</li>
            <li>The crowd-sourcer component needs to be carefully designed, certainly based on the experience of just this mapping app -- e.g. it might behoove us to move the backend to a wiki platform and harvest all data <em>from</em> there (rather than continue to store bit- and location-level data in MongoDB and CartoDB instances, respectively, and handle the crowdsourcing pieces from custom-built code. The very useful <a href="http://comedybangbang.wikia.com">CBB wikia instance</a> could become a mutual asset, for instance.</li>
