<p>This is primarily a map of every spatial reference from every <a href="http://www.earwolf.com/show/comedy-bang-bang/"><em>Comedy Bang! Bang!</em></a> episode ever recorded. Such as:
<ul style="padding-left:10%;">
        <li>the probable location of the <span class="copy-trigger" data-toggle="tooltip" data-string="point:17"><span class="loc-string">Nordstrom that sold Danny Mahoney his heavy suicide coat</span><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-map-marker cbb-trigger-inline"></i></span></li>
        <li>the very-difficult-to-actually-map location of <span class="copy-trigger" data-toggle="tooltip" data-string="point:410"><span class="loc-string">The Calvins Bee Honey Horse Fight Fields</span><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-map-marker cbb-trigger-inline"></i></span></li>
        <li>JW Stillwater's route <span class="copy-trigger" data-toggle="tooltip" data-string="line:52947"><span class="loc-string">from Cumberbatch County to L.A. via the Panama Canal</span><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-map-marker cbb-trigger-inline"></i></span></li>
        <li>basically <span class="copy-trigger" data-toggle="tooltip" data-string="huell"><span class="loc-string">anything Huell Howser has ever said</span><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-map-marker cbb-trigger-inline"></i></span></li>
    </ul>
    </p>

<p>...that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Technically, <span class="copy-trigger" data-toggle="tooltip" data-string='*:*'><span class="loc-string">all of the bits we've logged so far</span></span> are indexed here (not just the mappable ones), so maybe consider it a kind of pilot release of a larger project in which every individual trope and recurring bit (e.g. <span class="copy-trigger" data-toggle="tooltip" data-string='bit:"Open Door Policy"'><span class="loc-string"><em>the CBB Open Door Policy</em></span></span>, <span class="copy-trigger" data-toggle="tooltip" data-string='bit:"Titular"'><span class="loc-string"><em>titular</em></span></span>, <span class="copy-trigger" data-toggle="tooltip" data-string='bit:"Cake Boss!"'><span class="loc-string"><em>"Cake Boss!"</em></span></span>, etc.) will be not only searchable but supercuttable and wikified -- so that all Earwolf fans can help track the recurring CBB bits (or maybe there will be one each made for <a href="http://www.earwolf.com/show/spontaneanation-with-paul-f-tompkins/"><em>Spontaneanation</em></a>, <a href="http://www.earwolf.com/show/u-talkin-u2-to-me/"><em>UtU2tM</em></a>, <a href="http://www.earwolf.com/show/womp-it-up/"><em>Womp it Up</em></a>, etc. - I dunno, get off my back about it already). Actually I'm game for this (see the BitTracker section, below, for more on this) but that will all take longer than this already has and will require a much different web app to deliver.

<!--So while this thing technically does deliver
 , its primary purpose is to render . Such as:</p>
 <p>
     And for real the reason to do it is that the universe of CBB's characters - when canon - is so rich and sprawling that I wanted it all in one place, where I could wade into it from multiple angles, aspects, and facets. e.g. I wanted be able to visualize...
    So for now it's just a map of places that comprise the world of the CBB canon (and perhaps its diaspora).

But you wanna talk more about this bittracker? <strong>Yeah, it's a <em>BitTracker</em></strong>. A tracker of bits. How many times (and when) <span class="copy-trigger" data-toggle="tooltip" data-string='bit:"My Wife!"'><span class="loc-string"><em>My Wife!</em></span></span>; how many times (and when) a <span class="copy-trigger" data-toggle="tooltip" data-string='bit:Classic WYR Blunder*'><span class="loc-string"><em>classic WYR blunder</em></span></span>. That sort of thing. But in a way that doesn't just list them out (or map them, when possible) but instead wraps some other methods of access around them -- a supercutter, for example (e.g. "click - supercut all the <span class="copy-trigger" data-toggle="tooltip" data-string='bit:Please Call Me \"Garry\"*'><span class="loc-string"><em>please call me Garrys</em></span></span> together" or "click - supercut all of <span class="copy-trigger" data-toggle="tooltip" data-string='bit:Ducca List'><span class="loc-string"><em>Bob Ducca's lists</em></span></span> together"). Or the original dream - something built on the SoundCloud copies of the episodes that lets everybody add/edit/annotate all this bullshit. So think something like the <a href="http://comedybangbang.wikia.com">CBB wikia</a>, but with a finer granularity and a more data-focused approach.</p></div></div>



<!-- <div class="block"><h1>Is <em>Everything</em> Geocoded?</h1>
<p>But no, not everything is in here. Yet. Once I realized I wanted to do this, I started re-listening from episode 1, logging locations instead of bits (which I'll pick back up later). I'm only through #143, so there will be plenty more added here in due time. I <em>may</em> add the ability for users to submit/edit locations, but that requires the addition of a whole other layer of app logic. The crowd-sourcing model will better suit the BitTracker anyway.</p></div> -->

    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>As episodes are released, locations and bits will be added.</li>
        <li>As old episodes are revisited, missed locations and bits will be added.</li>
        <li>The web app might get an inline audio player (with or without annotation/edit capabilities).</li>
        <li>Some poor asshole needs to build the full BitTracker still (and fold this into it).</li>
        <li>The crowd-sourcer component needs to be carefully designed, certainly based on the experience of just this mapping app -- e.g. it might behoove us to move the backend to a wiki platform and harvest all data <em>from</em> there (rather than continue to store bit- and location-level data in MongoDB and CartoDB instances, respectively, and handle the crowdsourcing pieces from custom-built code. The very useful <a href="http://comedybangbang.wikia.com">CBB wikia instance</a> could become a mutual asset, for instance.</li>
