<p>Because...i dunno, why are <em>you</em> here? That's why. Or maybe <em>fuck you</em> and that's why. Could be! But actually it's just cuz <em><a href="http://www.earwolf.com/show/comedy-bang-bang/">Comedy Bang! Bang!</a></em> is the best thing ever recorded. Or maybe the best thing ever to even happen at all.<p>
