<div class="block"><h4>What's Really Going On?</h4>
<p>No, for real. Straight up. Professionaly I am a GIS Librarian, which is a job that, in my case anyway, has become almost explicitly a spatial web developer position. There are other systems involved but mostly my profession is to sit alone in a basement and type type type. But listen listen listen also, and that's how I'm able to comb over each and every CBB episode (multiple times). For fun, obviously, but also to pull out various references. You already know that this map is part of a much much larger "BitTracker" project, in which I'm logging individual tropes and recurring bits ("Please call me Garry," "My Wife!" "Titular," etc.) But that's taking longer and will require a much different web app to deliver. This thing I could kinda just knock off once everything was geocoded.</p></div>

<div class="block"><h4>*Is* Everything Geocoded?</h4>
<p>No, actually. Once I realized I wanted to do this, I started re-listening from episode 1, logging locations instead of bits (which I'll pick back up later). I'm only through #143, so there will be plenty more added here in due time. I <em>may</em> add the ability for users to submit locations, but that requires the addition of a whole other layer of app logic. The crowd-sourcing model will better-suit the BitTracker anyway.</p></div>
